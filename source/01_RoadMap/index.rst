Road Map
========

for Coding Trailblazers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Just like the start of any journey, equipping yourself with the right maps and tools makes the road ahead less daunting.

So pocket the road maps, sharpen your tools and march on!

   **Terminal**
   
   For a start, acquaint yourself with the coding terminal of your choice. 

   A **terminal** is analogous to a canvas on which you craft your coding masterpiece.

   **Input**
   
   In the terminal, jumpstart your code by introducing **inputs and variables**.

   Inputs oftentimes define the scope of the program. Therefore, it is wise to map out your program with a flow chart.

   **Process**

   With VBA Excel and Python, you may perform a wide variety of **processes** which include creating functions to automate algorithms.

   So, traverse your journey like a travelling salesman!

   **Decision**
   
   With an efficient code, you can sieve through data with ease and hone in on your desired endpoint.

   Conditional statements facilitate logical **decision making** while looping operations automate data crunching process.

   **Output & Debugging**
   
   Braving the entire coding process is no small feat, so you deserve to bask in the full glory of your algorithm at this stage.

   However, do not get disheartened if your code does not yield the desired results. Trace the tracks you blazed and **debug**!

Flow Chart
