Road Map
################

********************************************************************************
for Coding Trailblazers
********************************************************************************

Just like the start of any journey, having the right map makes the road ahead less daunting.

There are a few important milestones in the realm of programming.

For instance, **terminal** familiarisation, devising **decision** controls and attempting on **process** design.

While some of them might appear insurmountable at first sight;

Take them all in your stride with patience and an inquisitive mind!

So to the coding trailblazers: **Pocket the road map, sharpen your tools and march on!**

   **Terminal**
   
   For a start, acquaint yourself with the coding terminal of your choice. 

   A **terminal** is analogous to a white canvas on which you craft your coding masterpiece.

   **Input**
   
   In the terminal, jumpstart your code by introducing **inputs** and **variables**.

   Inputs oftentimes define the scope of the program. Therefore, it is wise to map out your program with a flow chart.

   **Process**

   With VBA Excel and Python, you may perform a wide variety of **processes** which include creating functions to automate algorithms.

   So, traverse your algorithmic pathway on the shortest route like a travelling salesman!

   **Decision**
   
   With an efficient code, you can weave through data with ease and hone in on your desired endpoint.

   Conditional statements facilitate logical **decision making** while looping operations automate data crunching process.

   **Output & Debugging**
   
   Braving the entire coding process is no small feat, so you deserve to bask in the full glory of your algorithm at this stage.

   However, do not get disheartened if your code does not yield the desired results. Trace the tracks you blazed and **debug**!


*****************
to Trailblazers
*****************

While coding can be quite an arduous journey to embark on, draw strength and inspiration from those who have walked the untrodden paths and blazed the trails.

As the saying goes: **Stand on the shoulders of giants to see further!**
