Road Map
========

for Coding Trailblazers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Just like the start of any journey, equipping yourself with the right maps and tools makes the road ahead less daunting.

So pocket the road maps, sharpen your tools and march on!

   **Terminal**
   
   For a start, acquaint yourself with the coding terminal of your choice. 

   While VBA Excel has its own built-in **terminal**, you can choose from a plethora of software to code in Python.

   **Input**
   
   In the terminal, jumpstart your code by introducing **inputs and variables**.

   Inputs oftentimes define the scope of the program. Therefore, it is wise to map out your program with a flow chart.

   **Process**

   With VBA Excel and Python, you may perform a wide variety of computations.

   Common **processes** include creating user-defined functions to automate algorithms.

   **Decision**
   
   With an efficient code, you can sieve through data with ease and hone in on the desired outputs.

   Conditional statements facilitate logical **decision-making** while looping operations automate data-crunching process.

   **Output & Debugging**
   
   Braving the entire coding process is no small feat, so you deserve to bask in the full glory of your algorithm at this stage.

   However, do not get disheartened if your code does not yield the desired results. Trace the tracks you blaze and **debug**!

Flow Chart
